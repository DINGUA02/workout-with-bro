workoutwithBro

A simple workout planner app with smart suggestions and AI-powered support.



Overview

workoutwithBro is a web-based workout planner created as the first major project for my coding bootcamp. It integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while demonstrating real-world usage of API calls and dynamic UI interactions.

This project fulfills a bootcamp requirement to build a feature-rich app using core front-end technologies. I also integrated the Gemini AI API to push the project further.
